# Kubernasty

An Alpine-based k3s cluster automation system.

Status: Very incomplete, it boots tho

Goals:

- OS is small and fully in RAM
- OS image is the same for each node
- Nodes have a small USB drive containing its nodename and a secret key (see [System secrets and individuation](./docs/system-secrets-individuation.md))
- Once booted, the nodes use the nodename and secret key to call out to the network and configure themselves in RAM
- Once configuration is finished, k3s cluster starts
